/*
There is a chocolate vending machine which contains at most N chocolates. The chocolate vending
machine is never remaining empty as when last K chocolates are left, the machine is refilled with
new chocolates in such a way that the machine gets full. There are C customers numbered
from 1 to C who want to buy some chocolates from the machine. The program must accept the
values of N, K and C integers representing the number of chocolates that the C customers want to
buy as the input. After processing each customer's request, the program must print the output
based on the following conditions.
- The program must print the string value "Customer: " followed by the customer's number.
- If it is possible to sell the chocolates to a customer's request, the program must print the string
value "Number of chocolates sold: " followed by the number of chocolates sold to the customer.
Then the program must print the string value "Number of chocolates available: " followed by the
number of chocolates remaining in the machine after the purchase.
- Else the program must print the string value "Invalid" as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= K <= N <= 1000
1 <= C <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= N
Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.
The second line contains C.
The third line contains C integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
For each customer, the first line contains the string value "Customer: " followed by the customer's
number.
The second line contains the string value "Invalid" or the string value "Number of chocolates sold: "
followed by the number of chocolates sold to the customer as per the given conditions.
The third line contains the string value "Number of chocolates available: " followed by the number
of chocolates remaining in the machine after the purchase.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 5
4
3 8 5 6
Output:
Customer: 1
Number of chocolates sold: 3
Number of chocolates available: 7
Customer: 2
Invalid
Customer: 3
Number of chocolates sold: 5
Number of chocolates available: 10
Customer: 4
Number of chocolates sold: 6
Number of chocolates available: 10
Explanation:
Here N=10 and K=5.
Initially the number of chocolates available in the vending machine is 10.
The customer 1 wants to buy 3 chocolates. It is possible to sell 3 chocolates. Now the number of
chocolates sold is 3 and the number of chocolates remaining is 7.
The customer 2 wants to buy 8 chocolates. It is not possible to sell 8 chocolates because the
vending machine has only 7 chocolates.
The customer 3 wants to buy 5 chocolates. It is possible to sell 5 chocolates. Now the number of
chocolates sold is 5 and the number of chocolates remaining is 2 which is less than K. So the
machine is refilled with new chocolates (now the machine has 10 chocolates).
The customer 4 wants to buy 6 chocolates. It is possible to sell 6 chocolates. Now the number of
chocolates sold is 6 and the number of chocolates remaining is 4 which is less than K. So the
machine is refilled with new chocolates (now the machine has 10 chocolates).
